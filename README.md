- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m AndrÃ© Schneider, a Computer Science student currently graduating in UFOP (Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto). I was born in the city of Belo Horizonte - MG - Brazil
and always had interest in nerdy stuff like those beautiful little machines we call computers.
- Even though I always had this interest, I never actually joined in any community in regards to programming and developing, maybe because I was too afraid to be judged by lack of knowledge.
However, I recently came to the conclusion that today, we developers have something those older ones didn't have: Easy communication, aka. the Internet.
So, here I am now, looking to learn even more by engaging with other people that have the same interests as me, joining projects, etc.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Cloud Development and Machine Learning, things that are new grounds in the whole Information Technology area. I'm looking forward to learn more every day
about those topics, given that the market could really benefit a lot having future professionals with proper knowledge about new technologies that are related to this.
- Currently, I'm collaborating on learningOrchestra project that you can see [here](https://github.com/learningOrchestra/learningOrchestra)
